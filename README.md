## Project overview

WRF-CMake adds CMake support to the latest version of the [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) model (here WRF, for short) with the intention of streamlining and simplifying its configuration and build process. In our view, the use of CMake provides model developers, code maintainers, and end-users with several advantages such as robust incremental rebuilds, flexible library dependency discovery, native tool-chains for Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal external dependencies, thus increasing portability, and automatic generation of project files for different platforms.

WRF-CMake is designed to work alongside the current releases of WRF, therefore you can still compile your code using the legacy Makefiles included in WRF and WPS for any of the currently unsupported features.

For more details, please see the short summary paper [WRF-CMake: integrating CMake support into the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) modelling system](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/9a87d84b2ed00ed82a6e297a4c34b3cf) on the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) website.

### Currently supported platforms

- Configurations for special environments like supercomputers
- Linux with gcc/gfortran, Intel, and Cray compilers
- macOS with gcc/gfortran and Intel compilers
- Windows with MinGW-w64 and gcc/gfortran


### Currently unsupported features

- WRF-DA
- WRFPLUS
- WRF-Chem
- WRF-Hydro
- File and line number in wrf_error_fatal() messages
- WRF-NMM (discontinued -- see https://dtcenter.org/wrf-nmm/users/)
- Automatic moving nests (via `TERRAIN_AND_LANDUSE` environment variable)
- CTSM land surface model


## Installation

The installation of WRF-CMake or WPS-CMake is straightforward thanks to the downloadable pre-built binaries for most Linux distributions (specifically [ RPM-based and Debian-based distribution-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)), macOS, and Windows (see [binary distribution](#binary-distribution-experimental) below) -- most users wishing to run WRF on their system can simply download the pre-compiled binaries without the need to build from source. Alternately, you can install WRF-CMake or WPS-CMake using the Homebrew/Linuxbrew package manager, or by building and installing the software from source -- please refer to the build and install [manually from source](#manually-from-source) and [using Homebrew or Linuxbrew](#using-homebrew-or-linuxbrew) section below.

Please note that HPC users, or users seeking to run WRF in the 'most optimal' configuration for their system are advised to build WRF-CMake manually from source or to use the Homebrew/Linuxbrew package manager.


### Manually from source

To build and install WRF-CMake or WPS-CMake manually from source, see [the install from source page](doc/cmake/INSTALL.md).

### Using Homebrew or Linuxbrew

WRF-CMake and WPS-CMake can be built and installed using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) (macOS) or [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#install) (Linux) with the following commands:

``` bash
brew tap wrf-cmake/wrf
brew install wrf -v
```


### Binary distribution (Experimental)

To download the latest pre-compiled binary releases, see below -- please note that these distributions are currently experimental, therefore please report any issues [here](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wrf/issues).

- WRF-CMake (`serial` and `dmpar`): [https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wrf/releases](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wrf/releases).
- WPS-CMake (`serial` and `dmpar`): [https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wps/releases](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wps/releases).


#### Note on MPI

If you want to launch WRF-CMake and WPS-CMake binary distributions built in `dmpar` to run on multiple processes, you need to have MPI installed on your system.

- On Windows, download and install Microsoft MPI (`msmpisetup.exe`) from [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56727](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56727).
- On macOS you can get it through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using `brew install open-mpi`. Note: Binary distributions < 4.1 use `mpich`, in which case you need to `brew install mpich` and possibly uninstall `open-mpi` first.
- On Linux, use your package manager to download mpich (version ≥ 3.0.4). E.g. `sudo apt install mpich` on Debian-based systems or `sudo yum install mpich` on RPM-based system like CentOS.


## Documentation

- For the WRF model technical documentation, please refer to [A Description of the Advanced Research WRF Version 4](https://doi.org/10.5065/1dfh-6p97).
- For the WRF model user documentation, please refer to [The Advanced Research WRF version 4 Modeling System User’s Guide](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/contents.html).

## Example usage

If you have already used WRF/WPS before and you just want a quick tutorial to go over the main steps, we have put together a very basic tutorial on our sister-project's website [GIS4WRF](https://gis4wrf.github.io/) with step-by-step instructions: [Simulate The 2018 European Heat Wave with WRF-CMake](https://gis4wrf.github.io/tutorials/wrf-cmake/simulate-the-2018-european-heat-wave-with-wrf-cmake/).

Otherwise, if you are a beginner, we recommend going [through the basics](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/Basics/index.php) or [running the case studies](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/CASES/index.php) as described in the [WRF-ARW Online Tutorial](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/).


## How to cite

When using WRF-CMake, please cite both model, and software (with version), e.g.:

> We used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al., 2018), WRF-CMake (Riechert and Meyer, 2019a) version 4.1.0 (Riechert and Meyer, 2019b) to ...

The corresponding reference list should be as follows

## How to contribute

If you are looking to contribute, please read our [Contributors' guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.


## Testing framework

In our current GitHub set-up, we perform a series of compilation and regression tests at each commit using the [WRF-CMake Automated Testing Suite](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wats) (WATS) on [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://dev.azure.com/WRF-CMake/wrf/_build).

When you build WRF or WRF-CMake yourself then you have already done a compilation test. If you like to replicate the regression tests, then follow the steps on the [WATS](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wats) page.


## Changes to be upstreamed

- `tools/gen_irr_diag.c`: Remove redundant `sys/resource.h` header include which would be unavailable on Windows
- `tools/registry.c`: Fixed incorrect Windows-conditional header include for `string.h` (needed in all cases, not just non-Windows)
- `var/run/crtm_coeffs`: Removed broken absolute UNIX symlink as this causes trouble with git operations in Windows
